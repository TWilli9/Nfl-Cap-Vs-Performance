# NFL Spending vs Performance Dashboard

An interactive data visualization project exploring the relationship between **NFL team spending (salary cap allocation)** and **on-field performance** across recent seasons.

This project uses **D3.js** to visualize team-level financial and performance metrics, highlighting trends, inefficiencies, and outliers in how teams convert spending into wins and success.

## 🔍 Project Overview

NFL teams operate under a hard salary cap, yet outcomes vary widely. This dashboard aims to answer questions such as:

- Do higher-spending teams consistently perform better?
- Which teams outperform expectations relative to their payroll?
- Where do inefficiencies in spending appear across the league?

The visualization allows users to explore these relationships dynamically rather than through static charts.
